    to start solving the worldâ€™s problems. You know that no person or
    company is big enough to make a difference on their own. But you believe

    intentions.`,

    Not now. Not ever. Youâ€™re passionate about breaking glass ceilings and 
    achieving gender equality. But you wonâ€™t stop there. Youâ€™re a big believer

    the environment. You might be vegetarian or vegan, or youâ€™re finding other 
    ways to reduce your impact like cutting down on plastic or getting rid of 
    the car. Either way, youâ€™re often found at rallies and protests and you get 
    fired up about the protecting the planet.`,

    Youâ€™ve researched the science and youâ€™re looking for ways to improve 
    your impact. But you want to change the world around you in a BIG way 
    and youâ€™re trying to bring others along for the ride. You know it takes 
    a lot of people to make a difference but you arenâ€™t afraid to throw
